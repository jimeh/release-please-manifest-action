# Features

- Supports having release-please authenticate as a GitHub App.
- Supports dynamic target branch based on regular expression pattern, enabling
  maintenance releases.
- Defaults to looking for release-please's config and manifest files within the
  top-level `.github` directory instead of in the repository root.

_Note: This action is not well suited for multi package/root release-please
configurations, as it does not support dynamic path-based outputs. A workaround
is to parse the `raw` output JSON string, but this is not ideal._

# Usage

All usage examples below assume you have placed your
`release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json` within the
`.github` directory in the root of the repository.

See release-please's [manifest-releaser][manifest mode] documentation for
details about the config and manifest files.

## Basic (Actions Token)

This example will have release-please authenticate using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`
that is automatically available to all actions.

This will prevent checks / GitHub Actions running against any Release Pull
Requests raised by release-please. This is a feature of GitHub as a means of
trying to avoid GitHub Actions jobs triggering themselves, and causing infinite
loops.

If you need checks to run against Release Pull Requests, you will need to have
release-please authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT), or as a GitHub
App.

<!-- x-release-please-start-major -->

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: jimeh/release-please-manifest-action@v3
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

<details>
<summary>The above is equivalent to:</summary>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: googleapis/release-please-action@v4
        id: release-please
        with:
          config-file: .github/release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .github/.release-please-manifest.json
```

_Note: Outputs are not included in this equivalence example._

</details>

## Personal Access Token (PAT) Authentication

This example will have release-please authenticate with a user's Personal Access
Token (PAT), performing all operations on behalf of that user. Allowing checks /
GitHub Actions to run against Release Pull Requests.

It is common to have a dedicated "bot" user created for these purposes. But
within paid organizations, that means an extra user seat needs to be paid for.
In that case you might prefer using a GitHub App instead.

<!-- x-release-please-start-major -->

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: jimeh/release-please-manifest-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PAT_TOKEN }}
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

<details>
<summary>The above is equivalent to:</summary>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: googleapis/release-please-action@v4
        id: release-please
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PAT_TOKEN }}
          config-file: .github/release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .github/.release-please-manifest.json
```

_Note: Outputs are not included in this equivalence example._

</details>

## GitHub App Authentication

This example will have release-please authenticate as a GitHub App, performing
all operations on behalf of the app.

This has a few benefits compared to using the token provided by GitHub Actions
or a user's personal access token:

- It allows checks / GitHub Actions to run against the Release Pull Requests
  raised by release-please.
- An app can be given permissions to access all repos within an organization.
- Compared to creating a separate "bot" user, paid organizations do not need to
  pay for an extra user seat when using an app.

Below we assume you have already setup `RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID` and
`RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets in the repository or organization.

To set the private key secret, simply copy/paste the contents of the `*.pem`
file you get from the GitHub App's configuration page.

<!-- x-release-please-start-major -->

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: jimeh/release-please-manifest-action@v3
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

<details>
<summary>The above is equivalent to:</summary>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        id: github-app-token
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - uses: googleapis/release-please-action@v4
        id: release-please
        with:
          token: ${{ steps.github-app-token.outputs.token }}
          config-file: .github/release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .github/.release-please-manifest.json
```

_Note: Outputs are not included in this equivalence example._

## Maintenance Releases

The `target-branch-pattern` input allows for dynamic targeting of different
branches. This means if you, for example, specify
`^(main|release-[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)$` as the pattern, release-please will run
against the `main` branch, but also against any branch named `release-X` or
`release-X.X`, where `X` is one or more numbers.

The practical use of this looks something like this:

- The `main` branch is used for latest development and latest releases. Let's
  assume it is on version 1.5.7 right now.
- The `release-1.4` branch was created from the latest 1.4.x tag, and fixes are
  backported to it from `main`.
- When `main` is pushed to, release-please will create a release PR to merge
  into `main` that bumps the version accordingly.
- When `release-1.4` is pushed to, release-please will create a release PR
  against the `release-1.4` branch instead of `main`, so a new 1.4.x release can
  be safely created.

The thing to be careful of when working on maintenance branches is that release-
please might try and bump the minor or even major version just like it would in
`main` depending on the commit types. This should be overridden by either doing
an empty commit with a `Release-As:` footer, or by modifying the commit types
when cherry picking.
